Facial Expression Predictor


Welcome to the Facial Expression Predictor project! This project aims to predict facial expressions using machine learning techniques. The model is trained to recognize emotions such as happy, sad, anger, disgust, fear and neutral.


Project Structure:

archive: Contains the train data and test data folders.
train_data: Training data for the model.
test_data: Testing data for the model.
template: Contains an HTML file for the user interface.
venv: Virtual environment folder.
flask_app: Flask application folder.
my_emotion_model_updated.h5: Trained model file.
train_model: Folder containing scripts for training the model.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Set up a virtual environment using venv.
Install the required dependencies mentioned in the technologies used.
Train the model using the scripts provided in the train_model folder.
Once the model is trained, run the Flask application located in the flask_app folder.
Access the web interface using your browser and start predicting facial expressions!
Usage
Training: Use the provided training data to train the model by running the scripts in the train_model folder.
Testing: Evaluate the model's performance using the test data.
Prediction: Use the Flask application to predict facial expressions in real-time.
